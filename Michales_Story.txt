  Have you ever eaten fast food? Well , I have and trust me I love it. But what are the risks of eating these fast food? How much nutrition does it have? And How will it affect me? Today, I will be talking about the above questions and explain it more detail.
  There is an immense risk in eating fast food. First, It is the main reason for why people get obese.Fast food contains a lot of fat which is bad for your health and may cause you to gain a lot of weight. Secondly, it is high in sugar and sodium which increases the risk of coronary heart diseases and diabetes. These are are really bad diseases which will cause you to suffer for the rest of your life.
  Fast food has little to no nutrition at all. As I said, it is high in fat, sugar and sodium and low in multiple vitamins such as Vitamin B, and Vitamin C which are important. It is also low in Iron and contains such substance like MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) which can cause multiple health problems.
  What will happen to me if I eat fast food. Acording to, XXX which did a census of how many American  families had fast food at least 3 times a week, XXX had eaten at least 3 times of week and all of them had been obese or where at the risk of being obese.
  Hence, to conclude my opinion piece I feel that eating fast food is okay but an excess of it is bad for your health. It can affect you and others around you. Instead of eating such food, you should eat healthy foods with more nutrition so as not to face these health problems.
